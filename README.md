# Password-Manager
Building a password manager using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI).

This code is an implementation of a password manager using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI).

The code imports several libraries:

tkinter: provides the necessary tools for creating the GUI.
messagebox: a sub-module of tkinter that is used for displaying message boxes.
random: provides methods for generating random numbers, choices and shuffles of a sequence.
pyperclip: provides a cross-platform clipboard interface to copy generated passwords to the clipboard.
Next, the code defines a function named generate_password which generates a random password using letters, numbers and symbols.

It defines three lists: letters, numbers, and symbols, which contain all the possible characters that can be used to create the password. The choice method from the random library is used to randomly select characters from these lists to create the password.

The password is created by combining randomly chosen letters, symbols, and numbers and then shuffling them so that the password is not predictable. The final password is then inserted into the password entry widget, and also copied to the clipboard using pyperclip.

The second function save is used for saving the password data to a text file. The function retrieves the website, email and password entered by the user in the corresponding entry fields. If either the website or password field is empty, it displays a message box asking the user to fill in all fields.

If all fields have been filled in, the function displays a message box showing the details entered by the user and asking the user to confirm whether or not to save the details. If the user selects "Ok", the details are written to a file named "data.txt" in the format: website | email | password. Finally, the website and password fields are cleared.

The code then sets up the user interface. It creates a window using the Tk() method from the tkinter library, sets the title and padding of the window.

It then creates a canvas widget to display the logo image, followed by labels and entry fields for website, email and password data. A button is also created to generate passwords, and another button is created to save the password data.

Finally, the mainloop() method is called to start the application and display the user interface on the screen.
